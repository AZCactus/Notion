#Notion
Synopsis

Hello! Notion is a web and mobile platform for brainstorming. Users can create and/or join a board and send their ideas to it on notes via mobile or web interface. Boards are stored in a database for easy access. Notion utilizes React-Redux, React-dnd, socket.io, node.js, and Sequelize.


Motivation

We've noticed inefficiencies in brainstorming from the inability to include individuals remotely to the short-term nature of a physical notes. We wanted to solve these problems and also give a delightful interface.
